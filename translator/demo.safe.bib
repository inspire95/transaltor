abstract={Unlike confidentiality and privacy concerns, the preservation of mobile phone service availability has not received the same attention from researchers, albeit an important factor, especially in business but also in life threatening situations. In this paper we present a methodology for testing practical battery deprivation denial of service attacks in mobile phones. We focus on attacks against the mobile terminal and not against the network. A variety of scenarios is proposed encompassing stealth Short Message Service messages (SMS), as well as very short calls interrupted before the phone actually rings. Both techniques are invisible to the target under attack and force the mobile phone to continuously transmit, consuming energy up to the point of complete battery depletion. Current flow and thus power consumption can be measured using a hardware based logger while a thermal camera can further measure the rise in temperature. Preliminary results show that it is trivially easy to launch an effective denial of service attack, with minimal cost and resources.},

pages={11-15}, 
abstract={There are many cases where a user's exact location has to be revealed and this can be done by locating his mobile phone. This paper presents a method to achieve this with great accuracy, only given as input the mobile phone number and the greater area it is located in (e.g. the city or the neighborhood). The methodology is absolutely autonomous and there is no need to install any software or application in the phone. Furthermore, no special infrastructure has to be in place in the area and no prior setup or prior arrangements have to take place at an earlier point in time before the moment the location trace is actually needed. The principle of operation is based on techniques that stealthily force the mobile phone to transmit radio waves according to the will of the tracer and on tracing the direction with appropriate direction-finding antennas, until the exact position of the phone is ultimately found.},

title={Improving the supply chain efficiency based on reliability analysis}, 
year={2015}, 
volume={},

pages={16-21}, 
abstract={One of the objectives of every company is to minimize disruption to its operation. It is an axiom of business that no business stands alone. The reliability of any business depends in part on the reliability of its upstream business partners. As a consequence, the level of disruption to a company's operations depends in part on the reliability of its upstream business partners. Every supply chain is composed of a network of businesses where each depends on upstream business for supplies and services. A reliability chain exists along supply chains. This paper models for improving supply chains efficiency by designing SC that is robust (i.e., perform well with respect to uncertainties in the data, such as demand) and reliable (i.e., perform well when parts of the system fail).},
